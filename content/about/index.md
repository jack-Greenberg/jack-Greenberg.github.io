Hi there! My name is Jack Greenberg
I am an engineering student at [Olin College](http://olin.edu) of ~~Arts and Crafts~~ Engineering, studying __electrical and computer engineering__.
I am most passionate about firmware/embedded systems and computer networking.

At Olin I am an electrical design lead for our Formula SAE team [Olin Electric Motorsports](https://www.olinelectricmotorsports.com) working on a brand-new [telemetry system](/projects/telemetry).

I've also worked at [Indico](https://indico.io) as a software engineer, creating a [secure permissioning agent](/projects/permission-cache) to decrease network traffic between their microservices, and upgraded their whole coroutine infrastructure with no integration issues.

I got my start with computers as a web developer working at [Yay Brigade](https://yaybrigade.com) over my __gap year__.
I also spent time living in Berlin working as a data architect for the [Norwegian Refugee Council](https://www.nrc.no/).

These days, I am spending my time learning about bootloaders, digital signal processing, and Rust.
