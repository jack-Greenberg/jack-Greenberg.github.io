Hi there! My name is Jack Greenberg. I am an engineering student at Olin College of ~~Arts and Crafts~~ Engineering, studying electrical and computer engineering. My passions lie in firmware/embedded systems and electrical design, and I also am quite fond of web development.

At Olin I am an electrical design lead for the Formula SAE team, [Olin Electric Motorsports](https://olinelectricmotorsports.com), and I am working for the machine shop to build a [brand new website](/projects/tools-olin-edu) to manage machine trainings.

Before coming to Olin I opted to take a gap year, partly due to burnout after overloading my senior year with math classes. I decided to move from L.A. to Berlin, and I got a internship as a data architect for the Norwegian Refugee Council.

After a few months in Berlin, I moved back home to L.A. and got a job at Yay Brigade as a web developer. I worked on projects ranging from web apps to monitor our clients’ website status (up or not) to implementing the design and identity for a new synagogue in L.A. While at Yay Brigade I also taught myself Python and worked on building a content management system with Flask and MongoDB.
