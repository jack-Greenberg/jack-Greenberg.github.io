      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote an implementation of the I2C protocol (inter-integrated chip) in C. I learned a lot about writing and debugging embedded firmware.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>My first project for Olin Electric Motorsports was redesigning the mission-critical brake system plausibility device. The analog circuit controls one node of the shutdown circuit on the car, helping to ensure the safety of the driver and vehicle.
How to PCB The final deliverable for this project was a PCB, or printed circuit board, which would slot into the car&amp;rsquo;s low voltage box. Along with performing a critical safety check for the electrical systems during racing, the circuit also handles the brakelight by reading an analog signal from a brake pressure sensor.</description>
