      <description>QEA presents NEATO: The Gauntlet Jack Greenberg
Click here to watch the final video.The Challenge The objective of this task is to get the NEATO to navigate a playpen&amp;ndash;&amp;ldquo;The Gauntlet&amp;rdquo;&amp;ndash;until it reaches the &amp;ldquo;Barrel of Benevolence&amp;rdquo; (a cylinder), while avoiding boxes. The NEATO will utilize its LIDAR scanner to process its surroundings with a RANSAC algorithm to generate a potential field and perform a gradient descent path-finding method.
The Hero The NEATO is a differential drive, two-wheeled robot that was simulated using a series group of docker containers, and interfaced with using the ROS (Robotic Operating System).</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote an implementation of the I2C protocol (inter-integrated chip) in C. The project was partly for my Software Systems class, and partly for the Olin Electric Motorsports team.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Hi there! My name is Jack Greenberg. I am an engineering student at Olin College of Arts and Crafts Engineering, studying electrical and computer engineering. My passions lie in firmware/embedded systems and electrical design, and I also am quite fond of web development.
At Olin I am an electrical design lead for the Formula SAE team, Olin Electric Motorsports, and I am working for the machine shop to build a brand new website to manage machine trainings.</description>
